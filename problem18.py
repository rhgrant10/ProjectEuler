"""Problem 18

Maximum path sum I
==================

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on
the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

               75
              95 64
             17 47 82
            18 35 87 10
           20  4 82 47 65
          19  1 23 75  3 34
         88  2 77 73  7 63 67
        99 65  4 28  6 16 70 92
       41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
      41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
     53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
    70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
   91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
  63 66  4 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
 4 62 98 27 23  9 70 98 73 93 38 53 60  4 23

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by
trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle
containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a
clever method! ;o)

The i-th item on row r has parents at i - 1 and i on row r - 1

The i-th item on row r has children at i and i + 1 on row r + 1
